<h1>I beg for a Prosthetic Leg for my disabled dog </h1>
<p>
"I beg for a prosthetic leg for my disabled dog. I don't understand why it is so hard to get them to give me one." I get that reaction often. My disabled dog, the Chihuahua, isn't only a dear friend to me, but also a member of my family.
When our last house was sold, there were lots of people to choose from, but we chose our dog, named Sassy, and he made the cut. He was so special to us, and we never wanted to part with him. He makes all of our lives easier because he is such a fun-loving loving energetic little guy!

There are thousands of handicapped dogs out there. All of them deserve a better life than the one they are living in now.
As my husband takes care of my dogs, I try to make sure they all have lots of exercises. Sassy, being the crazy little guy he is, needs his run a lot, and I do what I can to get him that.
We call him "Homer" because he will always ask for a ride or jump up on my shoulder. I'm not even kidding about that one. He likes to be in our company and watch television too.
Unfortunately, we have to leave the dogs at home a lot more. We know our dog can't work, much less run or play. There is nothing that we can do to make sure our dog is safe when we are gone. That's why I beg for a prosthetic leg for my disabled dog.
"Beginnforaaprostheticleg" is not my real name. It's his name. I've been called a lot of other things. Some people don't like dogs or cats. Others just don't understand.
In the middle of the summer, the dog was so excited to run outside and enjoy the sun. It was his favorite time of year, for the kind of fun we had. Then the weather turned and the dogs were trapped inside, afraid to go outside.
"Beginnforaaprost", he calls me, and every time I see him, I beg for a prosthetic leg for my disabled dog. He looks so sad when he sees me. He knows that I've been begging for him to get a leg, and he wants to do something about it.
Since it's so cold out, and I'm stuck inside with our dog, I try to sneak outside every once in a while to give him a hug and a kiss. "Bae," I say. "I beg for a prosthetic leg for my disabled dog."
He loves that I have a piece of his mind. Every time I think about getting one for myself, it's a dream come true for me. Not only for my dog but for all of the disabled dogs out there. I know how much work it is to get prosthetic legs for these animals.
"I beg for a prosthetic leg for my disabled dog." I don't understand why it is so hard to get one for a dog like Sassy.
